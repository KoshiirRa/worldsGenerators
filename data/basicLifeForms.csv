Algae	"This basic plant-like life form actually encompasses several different groups of usually relatively simple living organisms that capture light energy from passing stars through photosynthesis, converting inorganic substances into life-sustaining nutrients using the captured energy. Many forms of algae are traditionally regarded as simple plants, and indeed some are closely related to the higher plants. Others appear to represent different organism classifications, alongside other organisms that are traditionally considered more akin to animalkind, like protozoa. Thus algae do not represent a single evolutionary direction or line, but a level of organisation that may have developed several times in the early history of planetoids across the galaxy.<br />There are many different varieties of algae, but the most recognisable is that of a simple plant-like colony of loosely-walled organisms that live on or near hydrated recesses. It can be found anywhere that it can be well fed and get sufficient water (or similar liquid nourishment), and is very useful in sciences that require fast-growing examples to be studied. Some algae breeds are known to actually be capable of breaking down any manner of object they grow upon, but those are often too dangerous to keep around outside of a storage container.<br />There is a lot to be learned in the medical and botanical fields from algae samples, especially if harvested from a planet on which light and water are scarce. Sufficient testing and breeding could even help populations with food or agricultural difficulties develop a similar hybrid that could produce food at remarkable rates no matter the climate or ambient surroundings."
Bacteria	"Bacteria are very simple organisms that can be found nearly anywhere. There are strains that can live in the most crushing of depths or the blasted plains of a glass planetoid. Some forms of bacteria seem to survive devoid of atmosphere altogether. They are resilient and powerful in their own way, and they are omnipresent in the galaxy and beyond. From invisible pathogens that can bring death and disease to all-important necrotic decaying agents that make sure things get broken down when they die, bacteria is among the most important facets of life as a whole.<br />Bacteria are so widespread that it is possible to make only the most general statements about their life history and ecology. They may be found on the tops of mountains, the bottom of the deepest oceans, in the guts of animals and even in the frozen rocks and ice of the coldest of planetoids. One feature that has enabled bacteria to spread so far and last so long is their ability to go dormant for an extended period – allowing them to essentially avoid harsh times for their planetoid, or not be snuffed out by unexpected extremes of any sort. A bacterium generally survives; that is what it exists solely to do. <br />Finding a new bacterium is a gamble for Rim explorers. Without sufficient testing on galactic life forms, knowledge of what it might do if it was cross-strained with a different bacterium or even just what diseases it might bring with it, there is no way to know the damage a single-celled organism could inflict. It requires long and enduring tests, normally in an Isolab on board the exploration ship before ever getting anywhere near galactic space. For safety’s sake alone the samples must be kept so that they can be spaced or incinerated if it they pose a danger to the greater galaxy.<br />Useful bacteria can be helpful in a vast assortment of industries and scientific fields. There have been some discovered that devour pollutants and others that actually stimulate healing and cellular growth. Depending on what the bacteria is discovered to do, a buyer or investor can be found to profit on the tiny new organism. Even deadly pathogens can be at least brought back to be studied very carefully by the medical and military offices of the galactic governments. Whether it is to synthesise more to use as a weapon or to use as that weapon’s cure depends on the morality of the buyer."
Multi-Cellular Sub-Anima	"The term ‘sub-anima’ is used by xenobiologists to define animal-like life that is somewhere between common protozoa and larger, yet still simple, life forms like jellyfish. These organisms are almost always too hard to see with the naked eye, with a very few growing to the size of a printed period. The most basic of instincts fill the lives of sub-anima, with only the acquisition of food energy and the ability to reproduce taking up every moment of their short existences.<br />Many sub-anima reproduce asexually and can simply create new versions of their species through splitting or budding, meaning that even a single specimen accidentally brought on board and put in a food-rich environment could become millions of the tiny beasts in a few scant days.<br />Sub-anima are rarely harmful in any way and can even be very helpful in eliminating harmful pathogens and bacteria. Huge swells of certain sub-anima populations could result in the destruction of too much helpful bacteria or mould, thereby causing further problems in the long scope of things. This could be problematic over months or years, but there is no existing sub-anima that is inherently harmful to any known galactic race but anything is theoretically possible.<br />Rim explorers tend to gather sub-anima for studying purposes only. They are too ‘evolved’ to serve as any sort of base model of life for a planetoid, and generally have already formed their niche in the ecosystem. If the purpose that they serve is helpful, they could possibly be bred for that use – but not for much else, making them very specific ‘crop species.’
Slime Moulds	"A strange and magnificent class of organisms, slime moulds are basically enormous single cells with thousands of core parts. They are formed when individual slime mould cells swarm together and fuse. The result is one large bag of cytoplasm with the efforts and reactions of a single organism. These ‘giant cells’ have been extremely useful in studies of cellular movement and interactivity. In addition, the large size of the slime mould ‘cell’ makes it easier to manipulate and study than most cells.<br />Some slime moulds spend most of their lives as separate single-celled amoeboid hunters, but upon the release of a chemical signal, all of the individual cells aggregate into a great swarm to fall under one biological imperative. Cellular slime moulds are thus of great interest to cell and developmental biologists, because they provide a comparatively simple and easily manipulated system for studying how cells interact to generate a multicellular organism. The Gaim in particular seem to have a fascination with this facet of slime mould research. Something about the relation between slime mould’s pheromone-based communication and their own hive mentality may explain this fascination, but there has not been any official comment on the Intelligence’s behalf concerning the issue.<br />Rim explorers tend to gather samples of any slime mould they encounter in relatively large quantities if possible, as the mould seems reproduce by spores and may not be able to be bred successfully away from its natural environment. Depending on the size, type and complexity of the slime mould in question, several industries could be interested in a rapidly reproducing organism that feeds on harmful bacteria or perhaps dries into a very tasty condiment. There is no end to what researchers will try to find a use for, and slime moulds are no exception to that rule."
Viruses	"The most dangerous word on the lips of a Rim explorer, viruses are actually defined as microscopic particles that can infect the cells of another biological organism. At the most basic level, viruses consist of genetic material contained within a protective protein shell; the existence of both genetic material and protein distinguishes them from other virus-like particles that some scientists deal with. They can infect a wide variety of organisms such as animals and plants, or even such minor organisms as bacteria or sub-anima.<br />It has been argued extensively for centuries by a dozen galactic governments whether viruses are actually living organisms. Most galactic virologists consider them nonliving, as they do not meet all the scientific criteria of the generally accepted definition of ‘life.’ Viruses lack the means for reproduction outside a host cell, making them singularly and biologically focussed on trying to infect something in order to proliferate. This means that samples of other life forms might be carrying viruses in them when taken, possibly leading to unexpected infections and widespread contagion.<br />Viruses are one of the leading reasons Rim explorers observe very high safety measures and strict quarantine protocols at all times. Viruses are frequently sampled and studied in hopes of finding cures to the galaxy’s own viral ailments, but this requires coming into close proximity with infected parties or samples of their viruses. Only through putting the researchers’ heads in the proverbial lion’s mouth can they possibly hope to learn from the tiny particles."
