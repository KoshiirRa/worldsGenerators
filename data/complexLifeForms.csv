Avians	"This category of Complex life form encompasses all forms of birds (or related life forms), especially those capable of actual flight. They are often the easiest to find on many planetoids due to their travel across the sky, but that is not always the case. Many are flightless or even partially aquatic, but are commonly classified for their bony beaks, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a multi-chambered heart and a light but strong skeleton which has often been found to be hollow. Avians are rather advanced life forms, and can take many shapes and sizes.<br>Avian life forms are extremely diverse; some predatory raptors grow as large as a man, and berry-eating songbirds the size of a child’s finger have been sampled on several terrestrial worlds. With such a wide scale of life and variety of species, there is no way other than study and preparation for a Rim exploration team to try and take a sample of an unknown avian. Like hunting for an animal for which no one has a description, going out to catch avians without some kind of plan based on facts is likely to be fruitless.<br> Rim explorers who take avian biosphere samples, like capturing any form of unknown Complex life, must understand that they will not be able to provide the necessary environment for the animal to ‘function’ naturally. Without the ability to exercise their chosen form of movement avians are going to react differently, making them often better suited for posthumous research rather than observation in an artificial environment. Any animal can be a danger if handled improperly, but many avians are capable of flight – making them an ever present escape risk if not contained adequately. Rim explorers that take avian life forms as living samples can expect complications, even on those vessels ready for them."
Crustaceans	"Crustaceans are fully or partially aquatic arthropods that have tough exoskeletons that protect their soft inner organs from outside threats and the crushing weight of external pressure. They are similar in construction to other arthropods (insects and arachnids), but have gills or rudimentary lungs to help them in both aquatic and land-based environments. They are one evolutionarily step above simple life forms, evolving from their fully aquatic versions up into their land-based ones, and sometimes eventually on to insectoid species.<br>While nowhere near as diverse and specialised as their cousins, crustaceans tend to be designed to survive so they can reproduce – and that is about it. They rarely show any sort of communal behaviour except in the form of seasonal migrations, and only a few galactic species found in Abbai space have ever demonstrated intelligence beyond plain instinct. Rim explorers should be careful, however, as crustaceans are often naturally equipped for conflict – and are often armed with their own suit of armour and sometimes flesh-shearing pincers!<br>Taking a crustacean as a bio-sample can be as easy as putting one in a common research container, but others have shown powerful, almost hydraulic strength that could pose a threat to some container materials. Fully aquatic crustaceans will obviously need a supply of their own environment to sustain them as living samples, but not for posthumous research. Using galactic versions of this classification as a guide, Rim explorers who may be on their mission for a long time may want to make sure that any sampled crustaceans are not stored in containment units that are too small. Several known species can grow exponentially in certain circumstances; those evolved in unknown environments might be able to do the same or more."
Fish	"Fish are aquatic creatures that ‘breathe’ through gills that chemically absorb the gases they need from the hydrosphere of their environment. They exist in many shapes, colours, sizes and dependant infrastructures, and often exist in any habitable hydrosphere that can support them. Fish are the primary marine evolution of animal life and have high breeding rates.<br>There are fish that cover every aspect of biology. Bony fish, smooth-skinned fish, predatory fish, enormous fish and tiny fish are just a few of many different classifications of this life form. There are venomous fish that can poison with a stab of specially-evolved scales, or that toxic blood to exact retribution on the unknowing creature that eats them. Most known species of fish are harmless to an explorer with proper protective gear.<br>Unless explorers take deceased samples for posthumous research, fish of any variety will require a large amount of their natural environment in which to keep them alive for studies. Depending on the substance in which the fish dwell, this could lead to problems with toxic substances being brought onto a ship, or even just excessive volume of an aquatic environment. It is recommended that samples of a planetoid’s fish population should be cryogenically-based only. Aquariums for unknown species are too risky to keep on an explorer ship, even if all of the proper precautions are supposedly performed."
Greater Flora	"This is a large category that contains trees, flowering plants, tubers and any other ‘advanced’ forms of plant life. The components of this classification are the staple of an evolved ecosystem, and oftentimes the basis of the planetoid’s entire food chain. It is through their storage of food-energy in the form of eatable leaves, seeds and fruits that herbivorous fauna stay alive so that the carnivorous fauna can eat, eventually dying off themselves to become nutrients for the next cycle of flora. It is a long and twisted cycle that might take many years to fulfil its course, but it is a time-tested one that has created millions of life forms throughout the known galaxy and beyond.<br>Unless dealing with particularly dangerous (carnivorous, toxic or allergenic) plant life, the most difficult issue to overcome in studying flora is the sampling of particularly large species. Some of the trees on Androma grow to the size of starships, and there have been data records of even larger ones on some Rim planetoids. This could make for very difficult sampling, as the bark of such a tree might be metre-thick and as dense as deck plate. Also, any sample taken would likely be too small to get anything but a part of the cellular structure involved. Plant life is also rather delicate on an ecological scale, meaning that taking a species out of its environment could do it irreparable harm. This is a risk that some explorers must take in order to further research, and they take whatever they can.<br>Plant life is not a great security risk in most cases, with common containment methods and storage adequate for stable samples. There is always some risk when dealing with a particularly odd or resilient plant – like kudzu cuttings from Kokkar III – but most Rim exploration vessels can handle the sorts of flora they bring on board with ease."
Insectoids	"Possibly the largest group of complex life on record, insectoids are a grouping of both insects and their close relatives (spiders, scorpions, centipedes and so on). Like any other arthropods they have dense exoskeletons packed with fatty tissues and advanced organ systems. They are capable of great feats of strength for their size, with some tiny insectoids carrying up to 100 times their own weight easily! This makes them interesting organisms, but it also makes them quite deadly in their ways.<br>These life forms tend to be extremely numerous whenever present and are generally designed as best they can be for their lifestyles. Having a massive birth rate and generic evolutionary capabilities, insectoids adapt very quickly over just a few short generations to surpass whatever threat is upon them at any given time. There have been species discovered that have evolved beyond the effects of once-lethal poisons, developing thickened exoskeletons to survive increased air pressure, and even immunity to high-end radiation emissions. Insectoids do not simply evolve to avoid harm, however, they also adapt to their surroundings faster than any other complex life form. Many have learned true flight with a better degree of manoeuvrability than any bird can boast, some can leap several hundred times their body lengths and a few can even swim quite well. Insectoids adapt and survive; that is their main function.<br>Rim exploration teams that take insectoid samples must be very aware of just how durable and cunning these organisms can be. Some have evolved hive minds that bring their peers to help a captured hivemate, or even the ability to ‘play dead’ until they can spring back to life and attack their captors. Nearly every insectoid species has some way to protect themselves, be it with deadly venom or slashing mandibles, and researchers must be careful when dealing with their samples. Insectoids are far more powerful than they might seem."
Mammals	"This surprisingly large group is the class of vertebrates named and characterised by the presence of mammary glands in females, which produce nourishing milk for their growing young. Mammals are also known for the presence of hair or fur, even if it is very fine or nearly invisible to the naked eye. Many have naturally warmblooded bodies that force them to live in environments they are best evolved for, commonly using thick fur or blubber to survive in colder climates. They support advanced organ systems and are often very social animals.<br>Mammals tend to be separated into two main categories when being classified for sampling priority – predator or prey. Neither is going to be easy to sample without tranquilisers or some form of special trapping mechanism, as few mammalian animals will simply allow a foreign creature (the explorers, in this case) to snatch them up. Prey animals are far less likely to bite, claw or otherwise injure a would-be captor unless trying to get away; predator animals have a killer’s instinct and will gladly use their talents on a Rim explorer if they either wants to escape…or make a meal of the explorer. It tends to be animal instinct to escape capture, and that includes fighting the threat of same.<br>Unless a Rim exploration vessel is fully equipped for zoological study, the bringing on of large mammals could put a great deal of stress on the ship’s atmospheric processors and lead to possible illnesses. This can be helped by keeping the animals in their own isolabs, but very few ships stocked for Rim exploration journeys can say they have that luxury. The study of Rim-based mammals is left to small species that can be stored easily, cell-samples taken from tranquilised beasts or data recordings taken by witnesses in the animal’s own environment."
Reptilians/Amphibians	"This generalised class of complex life form contains all of the cold-blooded, non-fish life forms. They are normally (but not always) characterised by scaly, smooth or leathery skin devoid of true hair or fur, and are born from eggs (with a few cases of internally-hatched live births). That is where any form of comparison on a grand scale has to end. There are reams of differences between snakes, turtles, sauropods, lizards and frogs, and then again between their individual species and breeds. Reptiles are highly adapted and evolved animals that Rim explorers often avoid direct interaction with if at all possible.<br>Most species of reptiles are equipped for and very capable of defending themselves with sharp claws and/or teeth, and some have even evolved wickedly sharp fangs that deliver deadly venom to their prey or protective shells that can withstand PPG fire. They range from the extremely tiny to the titanic, and run the gamut of dispositions. Researchers commonly study reptiles for their spot in the overall evolutionary chain of a planetoid, due to the general reptilian pattern of evolving to a certain point and simply stopping. Many reptiles have the same body type and structural makeup as their ancestors did hundreds of thousands of years prior, sometimes longer. Scientists can hope to learn a great deal about the ecological evolution of a planetoid by studying the changes in the bodies of its reptiles.<br>Unlike mammals or avians, reptiles of a moderate size can often be stored or contained quite easily on board a starship. Most (if not all) reptilians are cold-blooded, meaning that they require external sources of warmth to heat up their bodies and keep them active. This allows them to be forced into a form of cold-based hibernation by researchers, simply by lowering their containment temperature until they slip into a form of ‘cold coma.’ This may not be a perfect solution, as the animal could have some kind of adverse reaction to the cold or have the ability to spontaneously and chemically stimulate itself when threatened during hibernation, but it is a well-used and tested approach to reptile storage on Rim exploration trips. As described earlier, reptiles are often quite formidable for their size and may have adapted interesting ways to deal with prey or attackers; sampling explorers should be very aware of that and not take chances with bites or scrapes that could be envenomed or infectious."
