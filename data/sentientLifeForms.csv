Humanoid (Aquatic)	"This type of life form spends most or all of its life under the hydrosphere of its given planetoid or moon. If this sentient life form is rolled for a planet that has no hydrosphere, then it is automatically assumed to roll ‘extra-planetary’ on the Origins table later in this chapter."	h
Humanoid (Amalgamate)	"This type of life form has physical traits of multiple archetypes of organisms, all working in unison. This cellular mixture is sometimes due to genetic alteration, rapid environmental shifts or the symbiotic organisms’ combination, eventually becoming one creature over several thousand generations."	h
Parasitical Dominator	"This type of life form describes the main manipulative creature in a relationship between two or more organisms. Be it a flatworm that drives a mammalian humanoid (Kor-Lyan) or an insectoid that can meld with anything (Vindrizi), the parasite and its host become one creature for all purposes."	p
Fungal	"This type of life form is actually a sentient colony of fungal matter. Although there are no existing examples of it anywhere in the galaxy, theoretical xenobotanists claim it is ‘possible’ to have a nonanimal reach sentience. Whether something like this would have a hive-mind like the cells of a slime mould or independent thought like fragmented colonies is completely unknown. Such a find would be priceless to xenobiology, and would bridge tens of thousands of hypotheses gaps."	n
Floral	"This life form is a sentient breed of plant life. Like a fungal sentient, there are no true examples of this in existence. There have been countless studies as to whether or not plant life ‘feels,’ with hundreds of professionals on both sides of the debate. Finding an actual sentient plant life organism would shock the scientific community, and answer a great many questions currently tabled until such a specimen can be found."	n
Energy-Based	"This type of life form is comprised wholly of some form of energy, be it bio-electricity, telepathic wavelengths or even a sentient form of gravity. There exist records of beings such as the Mindriders and the Vorlons having given up physical forms aeons ago, which leads scientists to believe that it is possible to find other transcended beings made of energy. Although the capture and study of them would be difficult, it is safe to say that anything so advanced to have given up its physical form should be able to be reasoned with…hopefully."	e
First Ones	"This type of life form is actually a grouping of life forms that could very well be made up of many different other types of life forms. Collectively called ‘First Ones,’ these are the progenitors of the galaxy and are ultra-powerful. The First Ones came and went beyond the Rim at their leisure until they were asked to leave completely in 2261, and finding a First One is like being in the presence of a god in both power and humility. These beings are both dream and nightmare to a Rim exploration."	e
Cnidarians	"These simple life forms get their name from the scientific term for specialised cells that carry stinging organelles, often found in long draping tentacles or stubby appendages held close to the main body. This family of life forms include corals, which are important reef-builders on any ecosystem they are found within, along with other familiar aquatics – sea anemones, jellyfish and sea wasps. They are only ever found in the hydrosphere portion of a planetoid, and require special sampling measures before they can be taken by a Rim exploration mission.<br>There are many different varieties of cnidarians already catalogued in galactic records, with some as large as dinner tables and others smaller than the smallest coin. They are extremely diverse depending on their surroundings, so many explorers may not be prepared to deal with those that evolved, say, in a 99% hydrospheric planetoid. The entire category of organism has evolved to gather up nutrients as they drift across their chosen home – seeing careless Rim explorers as nothing more than intergalactic plankton to be caught and digested.<br>Cnidarians are typically very simple beings that can answer many questions about what sort of hydrosphere a planetoid has, making them very useful to Rim exploration mission crews that may not have the proper equipment for a full aquatic exploration. By their very nature they can be quite dangerous – sometimes deadly – and research teams will often treat them with just as many safeguards as they would a deadly virus. When a single sting from a ‘jellyfish’ on Earth can kill, Rim researchers must think of what a similar creature found swimming in a sea of liquid sulphur could do."	n
Segmented Worms (Annelids)	"These wonderfully simple life forms are commonly referred to as segmented worms. Annelids are often found in nearly any moist environment, from the deepest marine sediments to the soils in many galactic city parks and agricultural homestead yards. Earthworms, leeches and marine-worms called polychaetes comprise the bulk of the diversity of the segmented worm families and are a sign that aquatic life has begun to move toward landbased evolution. They are a staple of evolutionist theory, and Rim explorers are almost always happy to find them whenever they can.<br>Like flatworms, segmented worms have a very fast and predictable reproductive rate when stimulated and monitored, making them a good research tool for genetics and immunity study. This does not mean that they are entirely harmless, but only a very few annelids are even capable of harming other life forms – and when they do it is often unintentional, due to a secretion or biological allergy. Leeches are parasitical by evolutionary design, but rarely voracious enough in small numbers to cause significant harm to their ‘victims.’ This is not to say that a new breed of Rim leech could not be focussed on nerve tissue instead of blood, or perhaps carry viral agents in its saliva. Researchers and explorers should at least be wary of new species, no matter how small.<br>Not that size has much to do with the description of segmented worms. As long as a worm has flexible body segments, a separate mouth and waste-vent and a complexdigestive system, it can likely be counted amongst the annelids. From the tiniest woodworm of Zhabar all the way to the bloated Spoo that can span several metres, the size of segmented worms is only limited by their lifespan and food supply.<br>Gathering samples of annelids can be tricky for an illprepared Rim explorer. The best and easiest way to do so is to gather up the entire area around the worm (a scoop of soil, or container of liquid) and taking all of it as a single sampling. This only works for the more commonly sized life forms, and can result in damage to the creature if the sampling device does not have all of the worm’s body at the point of taking. The good thing is that nearly every annelid ever sampled can regenerate from massive body trauma very quickly and efficiently. The bad thing is that it means that most of them cannot be killed without employing more drastic measures…should there be a problem."	n
Flatworms	"These are very simple creatures that are sometimes only a few cells thick, but are quite capable of moving and hunting down smaller creatures (sub-anima mostly) in order to consume them through their one orifice. They are capable of cellular regeneration on a wholebody scale, with one flatworm becoming two if there is an equal bisecting. Although little more than large, multi-cellular metazoa, flatworms are among the first indicators of an animal-kingdom evolution. Although nearly all members of this class of life are found in aquatic environments, they have been known to begin their slow evolutionary crawl onto moist land. The rare flatworms that do so often grow larger than their kin and develop thicker skin layers to keep from drying out instantly.<br>These creatures tend to be unknowingly parasitic, seeking out any source of food energy that they can gather. Whether by attaching to the roots of a plant or rasping the dead skin from an animal, most flatworms eat whatever they can. For normal examples of this life form type, this is not much of a problem. For some examples that have been found on Rim planetoids, there is no limit to the size and voracity of this classification – making many flatworms reminders that there is always a reason to be careful when dealing with a life form sample.<br>Rim explorers tend to try and get flatworms for study early on in an Exploration, as they are more or less an inexhaustible resource of test animals. So long as the flatworms continues to regenerate and divide evenly, the researchers can ‘farm’ more of them for scientific use. This can occasionally backfire if the flatworms’ cellular regeneration rate is much higher than anticipated. A large number of a new species always has its worries for a Rim exploration team, so precaution must be taken to watch flatworm numbers carefully."	n
Avians	"This category of Complex life form encompasses all forms of birds (or related life forms), especially those capable of actual flight. They are often the easiest to find on many planetoids due to their travel across the sky, but that is not always the case. Many are flightless or even partially aquatic, but are commonly classified for their bony beaks, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a multi-chambered heart and a light but strong skeleton which has often been found to be hollow. Avians are rather advanced life forms, and can take many shapes and sizes.<br>Avian life forms are extremely diverse; some predatory raptors grow as large as a man, and berry-eating songbirds the size of a child’s finger have been sampled on several terrestrial worlds. With such a wide scale of life and variety of species, there is no way other than study and preparation for a Rim exploration team to try and take a sample of an unknown avian. Like hunting for an animal for which no one has a description, going out to catch avians without some kind of plan based on facts is likely to be fruitless.<br> Rim explorers who take avian biosphere samples, like capturing any form of unknown Complex life, must understand that they will not be able to provide the necessary environment for the animal to ‘function’ naturally. Without the ability to exercise their chosen form of movement avians are going to react differently, making them often better suited for posthumous research rather than observation in an artificial environment. Any animal can be a danger if handled improperly, but many avians are capable of flight – making them an ever present escape risk if not contained adequately. Rim explorers that take avian life forms as living samples can expect complications, even on those vessels ready for them."	n
Crustaceans	"Crustaceans are fully or partially aquatic arthropods that have tough exoskeletons that protect their soft inner organs from outside threats and the crushing weight of external pressure. They are similar in construction to other arthropods (insects and arachnids), but have gills or rudimentary lungs to help them in both aquatic and land-based environments. They are one evolutionarily step above simple life forms, evolving from their fully aquatic versions up into their land-based ones, and sometimes eventually on to insectoid species.<br>While nowhere near as diverse and specialised as their cousins, crustaceans tend to be designed to survive so they can reproduce – and that is about it. They rarely show any sort of communal behaviour except in the form of seasonal migrations, and only a few galactic species found in Abbai space have ever demonstrated intelligence beyond plain instinct. Rim explorers should be careful, however, as crustaceans are often naturally equipped for conflict – and are often armed with their own suit of armour and sometimes flesh-shearing pincers!<br>Taking a crustacean as a bio-sample can be as easy as putting one in a common research container, but others have shown powerful, almost hydraulic strength that could pose a threat to some container materials. Fully aquatic crustaceans will obviously need a supply of their own environment to sustain them as living samples, but not for posthumous research. Using galactic versions of this classification as a guide, Rim explorers who may be on their mission for a long time may want to make sure that any sampled crustaceans are not stored in containment units that are too small. Several known species can grow exponentially in certain circumstances; those evolved in unknown environments might be able to do the same or more."	n
Fish	"Fish are aquatic creatures that ‘breathe’ through gills that chemically absorb the gases they need from the hydrosphere of their environment. They exist in many shapes, colours, sizes and dependant infrastructures, and often exist in any habitable hydrosphere that can support them. Fish are the primary marine evolution of animal life and have high breeding rates.<br>There are fish that cover every aspect of biology. Bony fish, smooth-skinned fish, predatory fish, enormous fish and tiny fish are just a few of many different classifications of this life form. There are venomous fish that can poison with a stab of specially-evolved scales, or that toxic blood to exact retribution on the unknowing creature that eats them. Most known species of fish are harmless to an explorer with proper protective gear.<br>Unless explorers take deceased samples for posthumous research, fish of any variety will require a large amount of their natural environment in which to keep them alive for studies. Depending on the substance in which the fish dwell, this could lead to problems with toxic substances being brought onto a ship, or even just excessive volume of an aquatic environment. It is recommended that samples of a planetoid’s fish population should be cryogenically-based only. Aquariums for unknown species are too risky to keep on an explorer ship, even if all of the proper precautions are supposedly performed."	n
Insectoids	"Possibly the largest group of complex life on record, insectoids are a grouping of both insects and their close relatives (spiders, scorpions, centipedes and so on). Like any other arthropods they have dense exoskeletons packed with fatty tissues and advanced organ systems. They are capable of great feats of strength for their size, with some tiny insectoids carrying up to 100 times their own weight easily! This makes them interesting organisms, but it also makes them quite deadly in their ways.<br>These life forms tend to be extremely numerous whenever present and are generally designed as best they can be for their lifestyles. Having a massive birth rate and generic evolutionary capabilities, insectoids adapt very quickly over just a few short generations to surpass whatever threat is upon them at any given time. There have been species discovered that have evolved beyond the effects of once-lethal poisons, developing thickened exoskeletons to survive increased air pressure, and even immunity to high-end radiation emissions. Insectoids do not simply evolve to avoid harm, however, they also adapt to their surroundings faster than any other complex life form. Many have learned true flight with a better degree of manoeuvrability than any bird can boast, some can leap several hundred times their body lengths and a few can even swim quite well. Insectoids adapt and survive; that is their main function.<br>Rim exploration teams that take insectoid samples must be very aware of just how durable and cunning these organisms can be. Some have evolved hive minds that bring their peers to help a captured hivemate, or even the ability to ‘play dead’ until they can spring back to life and attack their captors. Nearly every insectoid species has some way to protect themselves, be it with deadly venom or slashing mandibles, and researchers must be careful when dealing with their samples. Insectoids are far more powerful than they might seem."	n
Mammals	"This surprisingly large group is the class of vertebrates named and characterised by the presence of mammary glands in females, which produce nourishing milk for their growing young. Mammals are also known for the presence of hair or fur, even if it is very fine or nearly invisible to the naked eye. Many have naturally warmblooded bodies that force them to live in environments they are best evolved for, commonly using thick fur or blubber to survive in colder climates. They support advanced organ systems and are often very social animals.<br>Mammals tend to be separated into two main categories when being classified for sampling priority – predator or prey. Neither is going to be easy to sample without tranquilisers or some form of special trapping mechanism, as few mammalian animals will simply allow a foreign creature (the explorers, in this case) to snatch them up. Prey animals are far less likely to bite, claw or otherwise injure a would-be captor unless trying to get away; predator animals have a killer’s instinct and will gladly use their talents on a Rim explorer if they either wants to escape…or make a meal of the explorer. It tends to be animal instinct to escape capture, and that includes fighting the threat of same.<br>Unless a Rim exploration vessel is fully equipped for zoological study, the bringing on of large mammals could put a great deal of stress on the ship’s atmospheric processors and lead to possible illnesses. This can be helped by keeping the animals in their own isolabs, but very few ships stocked for Rim exploration journeys can say they have that luxury. The study of Rim-based mammals is left to small species that can be stored easily, cell-samples taken from tranquilised beasts or data recordings taken by witnesses in the animal’s own environment."	n
Reptilians/Amphibians	"This generalised class of complex life form contains all of the cold-blooded, non-fish life forms. They are normally (but not always) characterised by scaly, smooth or leathery skin devoid of true hair or fur, and are born from eggs (with a few cases of internally-hatched live births). That is where any form of comparison on a grand scale has to end. There are reams of differences between snakes, turtles, sauropods, lizards and frogs, and then again between their individual species and breeds. Reptiles are highly adapted and evolved animals that Rim explorers often avoid direct interaction with if at all possible.<br>Most species of reptiles are equipped for and very capable of defending themselves with sharp claws and/or teeth, and some have even evolved wickedly sharp fangs that deliver deadly venom to their prey or protective shells that can withstand PPG fire. They range from the extremely tiny to the titanic, and run the gamut of dispositions. Researchers commonly study reptiles for their spot in the overall evolutionary chain of a planetoid, due to the general reptilian pattern of evolving to a certain point and simply stopping. Many reptiles have the same body type and structural makeup as their ancestors did hundreds of thousands of years prior, sometimes longer. Scientists can hope to learn a great deal about the ecological evolution of a planetoid by studying the changes in the bodies of its reptiles.<br>Unlike mammals or avians, reptiles of a moderate size can often be stored or contained quite easily on board a starship. Most (if not all) reptilians are cold-blooded, meaning that they require external sources of warmth to heat up their bodies and keep them active. This allows them to be forced into a form of cold-based hibernation by researchers, simply by lowering their containment temperature until they slip into a form of ‘cold coma.’ This may not be a perfect solution, as the animal could have some kind of adverse reaction to the cold or have the ability to spontaneously and chemically stimulate itself when threatened during hibernation, but it is a well-used and tested approach to reptile storage on Rim exploration trips. As described earlier, reptiles are often quite formidable for their size and may have adapted interesting ways to deal with prey or attackers; sampling explorers should be very aware of that and not take chances with bites or scrapes that could be envenomed or infectious."	n
