Cnidarians	"These simple life forms get their name from the scientific term for specialised cells that carry stinging organelles, often found in long draping tentacles or stubby appendages held close to the main body. This family of life forms include corals, which are important reef-builders on any ecosystem they are found within, along with other familiar aquatics – sea anemones, jellyfish and sea wasps. They are only ever found in the hydrosphere portion of a planetoid, and require special sampling measures before they can be taken by an exploration mission.<br>There are many different varieties of cnidarians already catalogued in galactic records, with some as large as dinner tables and others smaller than the smallest coin. They are extremely diverse depending on their surroundings, so many explorers may not be prepared to deal with those that evolved, say, in a 99% hydrospheric planetoid. The entire category of organism has evolved to gather up nutrients as they drift across their chosen home – seeing careless explorers as nothing more than intergalactic plankton to be caught and digested.<br>Cnidarians are typically very simple beings that can answer many questions about what sort of hydrosphere a planetoid has, making them very useful to exploration mission crews that may not have the proper equipment for a full aquatic exploration. By their very nature they can be quite dangerous – sometimes deadly – and research teams will often treat them with just as many safeguards as they would a deadly virus. When a single sting from a ‘jellyfish’ on Earth can kill, researchers must think of what a similar creature found swimming in a sea of liquid sulphur could do."
Flatworms	"These are very simple creatures that are sometimes only a few cells thick, but are quite capable of moving and hunting down smaller creatures (sub-anima mostly) in order to consume them through their one orifice. They are capable of cellular regeneration on a wholebody scale, with one flatworm becoming two if there is an equal bisecting. Although little more than large, multi-cellular metazoa, flatworms are among the first indicators of an animal-kingdom evolution. Although nearly all members of this class of life are found in aquatic environments, they have been known to begin their slow evolutionary crawl onto moist land. The rare flatworms that do so often grow larger than their kin and develop thicker skin layers to keep from drying out instantly.<br>These creatures tend to be unknowingly parasitic, seeking out any source of food energy that they can gather. Whether by attaching to the roots of a plant or rasping the dead skin from an animal, most flatworms eat whatever they can. For normal examples of this life form type, this is not much of a problem. For some examples that have been found on planetoids, there is no limit to the size and voracity of this classification – making many flatworms reminders that there is always a reason to be careful when dealing with a life form sample.<br>Explorers tend to try and get flatworms for study early on in an exploration, as they are more or less an inexhaustible resource of test animals. So long as the flatworms continues to regenerate and divide evenly, the researchers can ‘farm’ more of them for scientific use. This can occasionally backfire if the flatworms’ cellular regeneration rate is much higher than anticipated. A large number of a new species always has its worries for an exploration team, so precaution must be taken to watch flatworm numbers carefully."
Fungals	"Fungals are plant-like organisms that lack chlorophyll or other energy-to-nutrient processors, requiring them to actually siphon nutrients from other sources. Many fungal organisms are good and useful, such as edible mushrooms or waste-decaying moulds. Some, like infectious or allergenic breeds or the rare fungus whose spores can set into flesh to grow and devour the host, cause severe problems. Medical mycologists (fungal specialists) study new fungal organisms to fight fungusbased infections and allergies the galaxy suffers from already, while agricultural and research mycologists study new forms of fungi to find their profitable industrial uses.<br>Since they cannot produce energy on their own, fungi must absorb nutrients from other sources. Most fungi ‘eat’ dead organic matter for energy, but some species have been known to start this process while the organism is still alive. It is the second variety that explorers must be extremely careful of. A single spore that clings to a environmental suit or slips past breather-filters could mean a painful death for the crew member, and possible infection for the remainder of the crew.<br>Organisms as prolific as fungal species are easy to collect and sample, but are a very real danger to any form of enclosed vessel or research base. Containment protocols are of the highest priority, like with a virus or bacteria, but a destruction-based contingency must also be arranged for in case of spore contamination. Common galactic fungi range from mildly allergenic to downright deadly; there is no way to know just how powerful, survivable or lethal a breed of fungus might be."
Molluscs	"The most advanced of all of the simple life forms; molluscs are typically comprised of a single body mass with some having tentacles or similar appendages, and sometimes hard shells they secrete. There are a multitude of different organisms found in this category, including snails, clams, squids, octopus and similar creatures. They have evolved digestive and locomotion systems, and many are very much capable of decision-making and learning from their mistakes. They are the largest step from simple multi-cellular organic ‘machines’ to fully independent animals.<br>From the early days of Earth, sailors feared the giant octopus for its cunning and predatory strength. It is clear that molluscs are not just simple creatures to be scooped up into a sample container whenever found. They can be quite dangerous, and some known galactic species are capable of killing sentient beings supposedly armed to hunt them – therefore, the unknown versions must be handled with due care.<br>Exactly how an explorer should approach sampling a mollusc depends on the given animal. It is necessary for the explorer to study the creature in its natural surroundings before trying to act, but watching too long could allow the creature to get away un-sampled. Moving too slow could allow the cure to all the worlds’ ailments gets away, but moving too quickly could result in the deadliest stinger on the planet shearing through the explorer’s suit and killing him. This conundrum can lead to lost samples or hasty actions – both which can be disastrous to a planetoid exploration. However, these are risks that some simply must take, if science is to learn about xenomolluscs at all."
Proto-Flora	"The general term ‘proto-flora’ covers all sorts of simplistic plants, speaking on a cellular level. Ferns, lichen, moss, ground grasses and most non-flowering vines fall into this category. They are a staple of most ecosystems and eventually turn into higher forms of life, especially if an ecosystem is to include any form of more advanced plant life or herbivorous animals. is the existence of protoflora is also a sign that a planetoid has a growing and evolving biosphere. Plants are always good indicators of a planetoid’s stability, as they are almost always the first to go when a drastic change takes place on a planetary scale.<br>Just because these life forms are plants does not mean that they are safe to simply transplant and collect as biosphere samples. Vines could quickly overtake a vessel with an unexpected growth spurt when brought into the ship’s higher-oxygen atmosphere. Lichen could develop an acidic root structure that can eat through a container…and a ship’s hull. A simple fern could have a powerful hallucinogenic effect on crew members because of its frond-pollen. Anything can happen with a new species, so assuming that a plant is safe because it is ‘just’ a plant is often a horrible mistake.<br>Explorers are expected to collect samples of plant life in two ways. The first way is just to take a cutting and isolate it in a sealed container for scientific study elsewhere. This is the safest way, but yields very little information about the species as a whole – it merely sheds light on the physical characteristics of the sample taken. The second way is far more time consuming and requires a better knowledge of xenobotany: the explorers must actually take the entire living plant as a sample. This often means constructing a much larger containment unit, using additional soil (or equivalent substance) and supplying hydrosphere compounds and atmospheric elements taken to keep the plant alive for study. There is some risk involved in doing this without knowing the full growth potential of the species, but it offers a vastly increased amount of scientific data for the exploration mission as a whole."
Segmented Worms (Annelids)	"These wonderfully simple life forms are commonly referred to as segmented worms. Annelids are often found in nearly any moist environment, from the deepest marine sediments to the soils in many galactic city parks and agricultural homestead yards. Earthworms, leeches and marine-worms called polychaetes comprise the bulk of the diversity of the segmented worm families and are a sign that aquatic life has begun to move toward landbased evolution. They are a staple of evolutionist theory, and explorers are almost always happy to find them whenever they can.<br>Like flatworms, segmented worms have a very fast and predictable reproductive rate when stimulated and monitored, making them a good research tool for genetics and immunity study. This does not mean that they are entirely harmless, but only a very few annelids are even capable of harming other life forms – and when they do it is often unintentional, due to a secretion or biological allergy. Leeches are parasitical by evolutionary design, but rarely voracious enough in small numbers to cause significant harm to their ‘victims.’ This is not to say that a new breed of leech could not be focused on nerve tissue instead of blood, or perhaps carry viral agents in its saliva. Researchers and explorers should at least be wary of new species, no matter how small.<br>Not that size has much to do with the description of segmented worms. As long as a worm has flexible body segments, a separate mouth and waste-vent and a complex digestive system, it can likely be counted amongst the annelids. The size of segmented worms is only limited by their lifespan and food supply.<br>Gathering samples of annelids can be tricky for an ill-prepared explorer. The best and easiest way to do so is to gather up the entire area around the worm (a scoop of soil, or container of liquid) and taking all of it as a single sampling. This only works for the more commonly sized life forms, and can result in damage to the creature if the sampling device does not have all of the worm’s body at the point of taking. The good thing is that nearly every annelid ever sampled can regenerate from massive body trauma very quickly and efficiently. The bad thing is that it means that most of them cannot be killed without employing more drastic measures…should there be a problem."
