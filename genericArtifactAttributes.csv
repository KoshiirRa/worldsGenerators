attribute	"<em>Call Artifact - </em>The artifact has two components – the artifact itself, and a homing device.  As a use of the artifact, you can cause it to return to the homing device from a distance of up to 20 squares.  Weapon artifacts appear in your grasp, and armor or gear artifacts appear properly equipped."	
attribute	"<em>Tech-Based Autoshields (Energy) - </em>Functionally, autoshields are treated as an additional hit point pool equal to 15 * the user’s Heroic Level.  While the autoshields are active, damage comes off the autoshields before applying the effects of damage reduction.  If you have any form of personal shielding (anything with an actual SR score), determine the effects on that before determining the effects on your autoshields.  The autoshield’s hit points are also reduced by 1 HP per round when activated. Autoshields reduced to 0 HP are not destroyed, but are temporarily rendered inactive (switched off). Autoshields regenerates lost HP at a rate of 1 HP per round while the autoshield is switched off.  Each activation of the autoshields (turning them on) counts as a use of the artifact.  Autoshields can only be used while an artifact is worn, handled, or wielded (in the case of weapons).  Each variety of autoshields protects against a different kid of damage.  The same artifact can have multiple types of autoshields – in this case, the artifact still only has a single pool of autoshields hit points, it just can be used to protect the user from multiple types of damage.  These autoshields protect against electricity, energy, fire, ion, radiation, and stun damage.  When protecting from radiation, any damage that the user would take from the radiation is dealt to the autoshields."

These autoshields protect against bludgeoning/slashing/piercing damage, that is – damage that does all three kinds at once.  The most common source of this damage is explosions."
